JournalSprouts: Journal Every Day!

Project Status: V1.0.0 (Minimum Viable Product - Completed)

JournalSprouts is a small journaling application designed to encourage daily writing by giving the user a digital garden, and tasking them with keeping it alive and healthy by journaling every day.

This initial V1.0.0 MVP was scoped strictly to demonstrate an understanding of core web technologies before introducing complex frameworks.

V1.0.0 Features (What is finished so far):
-Journal Entry & Persistence: Allows users to input and save their journal entries to their browsers localStorage.
- Streak Logic: Calculating the users streak (number of consecutive days an entry has been made) and making the garden behave accordingly.
- Simple Scope: All features were built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (No frameworks yet)

Try it out!


Future Development (V2.0.0 and further):
The following features are planned for later versions, with newer technologies to be used as learning excercises

V2.0.0: The UI/UX Update:
- Transition to React to manage component based UI and complex states
- Implement multiple distinct plant types based off journaling style
- Enhanced and more responsive CSS using SASS

V3.0.0: The Full Stack Update:
- Integrating a back-end server and a database 
- Add user authentication so that you can bring your journal across devices
